to do:
x add event listeners to checkboxes
x add check to data structure to see if data already been called
x get value from check box and use to make api call
x parse api data and return from function that makes call
x better date format?
x add data to graph
x fix wrong dates
x refactor code so make graph just takes dataset, pull make subset and get data out of it
- add checkbox to select all states
- add option to divide by population of states
x scale doesn't clear in between adding states and takin away
x need to add css to make presentable
x ensure responsive.  (mistake to leave this too the end)
x add way to destory graph while window is being resized
x add listener for graph type
- save color for each state
x add media query for mobile
x make graph full screen on mobile
- make graph height bigger.  might be auto right now
- filter out negative numbers

graphs 
x new daily deaths/cases
- new cases per infection- if below one then virus would die out
x three day avg deats/ cases https://www.statisticshowto.com/moving-average/
- weekly growth rate 

notes:

started by working on logic of calls and making displays

1. made api call.  Figured out how to make multiple api calls.  Works but probably not necessary since the graph is made each time a box is checked and not possible to check more than one box at a time.  struggled with await and async for no reason.  ended up refactoring code a number of times to get organization that worked with async.  

2. graphed data with dates.  tinkering required to get it to actually graph by date.  not sure what i did to fix the problem in the end.  Still no parsing dates correctly for some reason

3. added event lisnters to check boxes for states.  no real difficulties here

4. avoid duplicate api calls by saving a past calls in object.  required refactoring cods and working through bugs.

5.  added option to graph different parts of data from api.  just required tinkering with existing code and adding some paramters to existing functions calls. functions calls

6. fixed scale issues when making repeated calls.  used chart destroy() which found lot of hacky solutions online because apparently I'm not the only one who couldn't get it to work.  had to catch the chart opbject in global var, but it was promise so couldn't call desotry on it.  solution was to call then on promise to destroy it in function within then

7. made states a flex items so they can be in rows.  made graph as soon as page loads to give better visual clue about what to do for user.  

8. used flex box to make things look nicer.  adjust check boxes.  trying to use to center everything, but it breaks everything for some reason.  try set width of input cotainers to 100 percent and container container to 80%.  problem was width instead of max width but still decided to cetner everything horizontally in one big container


9. added fonts added event listener for graph type radio

10.  get states to look nice.  overflow out of div if min not set then they don't make multiple columns.  solution was to make rows and then set width to large enought ot accomodate state names

890 lines

11. added more graphing options 7 day avg.  debugging took some time.  added title
