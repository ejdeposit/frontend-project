to do:
x add event listeners to checkboxes
x add check to data structure to see if data already been called
x get value from check box and use to make api call
x parse api data and return from function that makes call
x better date format?
x add data to graph

- refactor code so make graph just takes dataset, pull make subset and get data out of it
- add checkbox to select all states
- add option to divide by population of states
- scale doesn't clear in between adding states and takin away

other graphs
